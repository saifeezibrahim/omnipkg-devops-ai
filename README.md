`omnipkg` is not just another package manager. It's an **intelligent, self-healing runtime orchestrator** that breaks the fundamental laws of Python environments. For 30 years, developers accepted that you couldn't run multiple Python versions in one script, or safely switch C-extensions like NumPy mid-execution. **Omnipkg proves this is no longer true.**

Born from a real-world nightmare—a forced downgrade that wrecked a production environment—`omnipkg` was built to solve what others couldn't: achieving perfect dependency isolation and runtime adaptability without the overhead of containers or multiple venvs.

## ⚖️ Multi-Version Support

[![omnipkg](https://img.shields.io/badge/omnipkg-2462%20Wins-brightgreen?logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/omnipkg_vs_the_world.yml) [![pip](https://img.shields.io/badge/pip-2465%20Failures-red?logo=pypi&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/omnipkg_vs_the_world.yml) [![uv](https://img.shields.io/badge/uv-2465%20Failures-red?logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/omnipkg_vs_the_world.yml)

*Multi-version installation tests run every 3 hours. [Live results here.](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/omnipkg_vs_the_world.yml)*

---

<!-- COMPARISON_STATS_END -->

## 💡 Why This Matters

**The Multi-Version Nightmare is Over**: Modern projects are messy. You need `tensorflow==2.10` for a legacy model but `tensorflow==2.15` for new training. A critical library requires `numpy==1.21` while your latest feature needs `numpy==2.0`. Traditional solutions like Docker or virtual environments force you into a painful choice: duplicate entire environments, endure slow context switching, or face crippling dependency conflicts.

**The Multi-Interpreter Wall is Gone**: Legacy codebases often require older Python versions (e.g., Django on 3.8) while modern ML demands the latest (Python 3.11+). This forces developers to constantly manage and switch between separate, isolated environments, killing productivity.

**The `omnipkg` Solution: One Environment, Infinite Python Versions & Packages, Zero Conflicts, Downtime, or Setup. Faster than UV.**

`omnipkg` doesn't just solve these problems—it makes them irrelevant.
*   **Run Concurrently:** Execute tests for Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 **at the same time, from one command, test is done in under 500ms**. No more sequential CI jobs.
*   **Switch Mid-Script:** Seamlessly use `torch==2.0.0` and `torch==2.7.1` in the same script without restarting.
*   **Instant Healing:** Recover from environment damage in microseconds, not hours.
*   **Speak Your Language:** All of this, in your native tongue.

This is the new reality: one environment, one script, everything **just works**.

## 🧠 Revolutionary Core Features

### 1. Multiverse Orchestration & Python Hot-Swapping [![<600ms 3 Py Interps 1 Script 1 Env](https://img.shields.io/badge/<600ms%203%20Py%20Interps%201%20Script%201%20Env-passing-success?logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/multiverse_test.yml)

## The "Quantum Multiverse Warp": 3 Pythons, 1 Script, < 600ms

Our "Quantum Multiverse Warp" demo, validated live in our CI, executes a single script across three different Python interpreters and three package versions **concurrently** in the same environment. The results are not just fast; they redefine what's possible for CI/CD.

| Task (Same Script, Same Environment) | Execution Time |
| REDACTED | :------------: |
| 🧵 **Thread 1:** Python 3.9 + Rich 13.4.2  | ✅ **579.6ms**   |
| 🧵 **Thread 2:** Python 3.10 + Rich 13.6.0 | ✅ **548.4ms**   |
| 🧵 **Thread 3:** Python 3.11 + Rich 13.7.1 | ✅ **571.8ms**   |
| 🏆 **Total Concurrent Runtime**        | **580.1ms**      |

This isn't just a speedup; it's a paradigm shift. What traditionally takes minutes with Docker or complex venv scripting, `omnipkg` accomplishes in **under 600 milliseconds**. This isn't a simulation; it's a live, production-ready capability for high-performance Python automation.

Don't believe it? See the live proof, then run **Demo 8** to experience it yourself.
```bash
uv pip install omnipkg && omnipkg demo

**Live CI Output from Multiverse Analysis:**

### 2. Real-Time Auto-Healing & Environment Repair [![⚡ Auto-Healing: 7.76x Faster than UV](https://img.shields.io/badge/⚡_Auto--Healing-7.76x_Faster_than_UV-gold?logo=lightning&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/old_rich_test.yml)

`omnipkg` is the first tool that **actively repairs** your environment while you work.
- **`omnipkg run`**: Our intelligent script runner detects `ModuleNotFoundError`, `AssertionError` (for version conflicts), and even NumPy C-extension failures. It then automatically creates and activates a version-specific "bubble" to heal the script, often completing the entire process **faster than other tools take to simply fail.**
- **The Ghost Hunter**: On every startup, `omnipkg` proactively scans all managed `site-packages` for corrupted installations (e.g., `~temp-name.dist-info`) left behind by failed `pip` installs and surgically removes them, preventing environment rot before it starts.

**Live CI Output from Auto-Healing:**
```bash
⏱️  UV run failed in: 5379.237 ms (5,379,236,666 ns)
🔍 NumPy 2.0 compatibility issue detected. Auto-healing with numpy downgrade...
   - Downgrading to numpy<2.0 for compatibility
✅ Using bubble: numpy-1.26.4

🚀 Re-running with omnipkg auto-heal...

### 3. Dynamic Package Switching [![💥 Nuclear Test: NumPy+SciPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/💥_Nuclear_Test:NumPy+SciPy-passing-success)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/numpy-scipy-c-extension-test.yml)

Switch package versions mid-script using `omnipkgLoader`, without restarting or changing environments. `omnipkg` seamlessly juggles C-extension packages like `numpy` and `scipy` in the same Python process. The loader even handles complex **nested dependency contexts**, a feat unmatched by other tools.

**Example Code:**
```python
from omnipkg.loader import omnipkgLoader
from omnipkg.core import ConfigManager # Recommended for robust path discovery

config = ConfigManager().config # Load your omnipkg config once

with omnipkgLoader("numpy==1.24.3", config=config):
    import numpy
    print(numpy.__version__)  # Outputs: 1.24.3
import numpy # Re-import/reload might be needed if numpy was imported before the 'with' block
print(numpy.__version__)  # Outputs: Original main env version (e.g., 1.26.4)
```

**Key CI Output Excerpts (Nested Loaders):**
```bash
--- Nested Loader Test ---
🌀 Testing nested loader usage...
✅ Outer context - Typing Extensions: 4.5.0
🌀 omnipkg loader: Activating tensorflow==2.13.0...
✅ Inner context - TensorFlow: 2.13.0
✅ Inner context - Typing Extensions: 4.5.0
✅ Nested loader test: Model created successfully
```

### 4. 🌍 Global Intelligence & AI-Driven Localization [![🤖 AI-Powered: 24 Languages](https://img.shields.io/badge/🤖REDACTED?logo=openai&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/language_test.yml)

`omnipkg` eliminates language barriers with advanced AI localization supporting 24+ languages, making package management accessible to developers worldwide in their native language.

**Key Features**: Auto-detection from system locale, competitive AI translation models, context-aware technical term handling, and continuous self-improvement from user feedback.

```bash
# Set language permanently
omnipkg config set language zh_CN
# ✅ Language permanently set to: 中文 (简体)

# Temporary language override
omnipkg --lang es install requests

# View current configuration
cat ~/.config/omnipkg/config.json
```
Zero setup required—works in your language from first run with graceful fallbacks and clear beta transparency.

### 5. Downgrade Protection & Conflict Resolution [![🔧 Simple UV Multi-Version Test](https://img.shields.io/badge/🔧REDACTED)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/test_uv_install.yml)

`omnipkg` automatically reorders installations and isolates conflicts, preventing environment-breaking downgrades.

**Example: Conflicting `torch` versions:**
```bash
omnipkg install torch==2.0.0 torch==2.7.1
```

**What happens?** `omnipkg` reorders installs to trigger the bubble creation, installs `torch==2.7.1` in the main environment, and isolates `torch==2.0.0` in a lightweight "bubble," sharing compatible dependencies to save space. No virtual environments or containers needed.

```bash
🔄 Reordered: torch==2.7.1, torch==2.0.0
📦 Installing torch==2.7.1... ✅ Done
🛡️ Downgrade detected for torch==2.0.0
🫧 Creating bubble for torch==2.0.0... ✅ Done
🔄 Restoring torch==2.7.1... ✅ Environment secure
```
---

### 6. Deep Package Intelligence with Import Validation [![🔍 Package Discovery Demo](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/knowledge_base_check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/knowledge_base_check.yml)
`omnipkg` goes beyond simple version tracking, building a deep knowledge base (in Redis or SQLite) for every package. In v1.5.0, this now includes **live import validation** during bubble creation.
- **The Problem:** A package can be "installed" but still be broken due to missing C-extensions or incorrect `sys.path` entries.
- **The Solution:** When creating a bubble, `omnipkg` now runs an isolated import test for every single dependency. It detects failures (e.g., `absl-py: No module named 'absl_py'`) and even attempts to automatically repair them, ensuring bubbles are not just created, but are **guaranteed to be functional.**



**Example Insight:**
```bash
omnipkg info uv
📋 KEY DATA for 'uv':
🎯 Active Version: 0.8.11
🫧 Bubbled Versions: 0.8.10

---[ Health & Security ]---
🔒 Security Issues : 0  
🛡️ Audit Status  : checked_in_bulk
✅ Importable      : True
```

| **Intelligence Includes** | **Redis/SQLite Superpowers** |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| • Binary Analysis (ELF validation, file sizes) | • 0.2ms metadata lookups |
| • CLI Command Mapping (all subcommands/flags) | • Compressed storage for large data |
| • Security Audits (vulnerability scans) | • Atomic transaction safety |
| • Dependency Graphs (conflict detection) | • Intelligent caching of expensive operations |
| • Import Validation (runtime testing) | • Enables future C-extension symlinking |

### 7. Instant Environment Recovery

[![🛡️ UV Revert Test](https://img.shields.io/badge/🛡️_UV_Revert_Test-passing-success)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/test_uv_revert.yml)


If an external tool (like `pip` or `uv`) causes damage, `omnipkg revert` restores your environment to a "last known good" state in seconds.

**Key CI Output Excerpt:**

```bash
Initial uv version (omnipkg-installed):uv 0.8.11
$ uv pip install uv==0.7.13
 - uv==0.8.11
 + uv==0.7.13
uv self-downgraded successfully.
Current uv version (after uv's operation): uv 0.7.13

⚖️  Comparing current environment to the last known good snapshot...
📝 The following actions will be taken to restore the environment:
  - Fix Version: uv==0.8.11
🚀 Starting revert operation...
✅ Environment successfully reverted to the last known good state.

### 📝 Special Installation Notes

#### Ubuntu 24.04+ / Debian 12+ (PEP 668)
Modern Debian/Ubuntu enforce PEP 668 to protect system packages:
```bash
# Use --break-system-packages flag
python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages omnipkg

# Or use a virtual environment (recommended for development)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install omnipkg
```

#### Rocky/Alma Linux 8 (Python 3.6 → 3.9)
EL8 ships with Python 3.6, which is too old for modern `pyproject.toml`:
```bash
# Install Python 3.9 first
sudo dnf install -y python39 python39-pip

# Make python3 point to 3.9
sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python3
sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/pip3.9 /usr/bin/pip3

# Now install omnipkg
python3 -m pip install omnipkg
```

#### Alpine Linux (Build Dependencies)
Alpine requires build tools for dependencies like `psutil`:
```bash
# Install build tools first
apk add --no-cache gcc python3-dev musl-dev linux-headers

# Then install omnipkg
python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages omnipkg
```

#### Arch Linux
```bash
# Arch uses --break-system-packages for global installs
python -m pip install --break-system-packages omnipkg

# Or use pacman if available in AUR (future)
yay -S python-omnipkg
```

### 🐍 Python Version Support

**Supported:** Python 3.7 - 3.14 (including beta/rc releases)

**Architecture:** `noarch` (pure Python, no compiled extensions)

This means omnipkg runs on **any** architecture where Python is available:
- ✅ **x86_64** (Intel/AMD) - verified in CI
- ✅ **ARM32** (armv6/v7) - [verified on piwheels](https://www.piwheels.org/project/omnipkg/)
- ✅ **ARM64** (aarch64) - Python native support
- ✅ **RISC-V, POWER, s390x** - anywhere Python runs!

<!-- PLATFORM_SUPPORT_END -->

<!-- ARM64_STATUS_START -->
### ✅ ARM64 Support Verified (QEMU)

[![ARM64 Verified](https://img.shields.io/badge/ARM64_(aarch64)-6/6%20Verified-success?logo=linux&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/arm64-verification.yml)

**`omnipkg` is fully verified on ARM64.** This was achieved without needing expensive native hardware by using a powerful QEMU emulation setup on a self-hosted x86_64 runner. This process proves that the package installs and functions correctly on the following ARM64 Linux distributions:

| Platform                 | Architecture    | Status | Notes           |
|--------------------------|-----------------|:------:|-----------------|
| Debian 12 (Bookworm)     | ARM64 (aarch64) |   ✅   | QEMU Emulation  |
| Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble)     | ARM64 (aarch64) |   ✅   | QEMU Emulation  |
| Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy)     | ARM64 (aarch64) |   ✅   | QEMU Emulation  |
| Fedora 39                | ARM64 (aarch64) |   ✅   | QEMU Emulation  |
| Rocky Linux 9            | ARM64 (aarch64) |   ✅   | QEMU Emulation  |
| Alpine Linux             | ARM64 (aarch64) |   ✅   | QEMU Emulation  |

This verification acts as a critical pre-release gate, ensuring that any version published to PyPI is confirmed to work for ARM64 users before it's released.

### Instant Demo

```bash
omnipkg demo
```

Choose from:
1. Rich test (Python module switching)
2. UV test (binary switching)
3. NumPy + SciPy stress test (C-extension switching)
4. TensorFlow test (complex dependency switching)
5. 🚀 Multiverse Healing Test (Cross-Python Hot-Swapping Mid-Script)
6. Flask test (under construction)
7. Auto-healing Test (omnipkg run)
8. 🌠 Quantum Multiverse Warp (Concurrent Python Installations)

### Experience Python Hot-Swapping

```bash
# Let omnipkg manage your native Python automatically
omnipkg status
# 🎯 Your native Python is now managed!

# See available interpreters
omnipkg info python

# Install a new Python version if needed (requires Python >= 3.10)
omnipkg python adopt 3.10

# Hot-swap your entire shell context
omnipkg swap python 3.10
python --version  # Now Python 3.10.x
```

### Optional: Enhanced Performance with Redis

For maximum performance, install Redis:

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**:
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install redis-server
sudo systemctl enable redis && sudo systemctl start redis
```

**macOS (Homebrew)**:
```bash
brew install redis && brew services start redis
```

**Windows**: Use WSL2 or Docker:
```bash
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name redis-omnipkg redis
```

Verify Redis: `redis-cli ping` (should return `PONG`)
