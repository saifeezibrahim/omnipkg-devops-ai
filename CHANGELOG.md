## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-08 - "The Singularity"

**The "Hypervisor" Update.**
This release marks a fundamental paradigm shift from "Package Loader" to "Distributed Runtime Architecture." OmniPkg 2.0 introduces a persistent daemon kernel, universal GPU IPC, and hardware-level isolation, effectively functioning as an Operating System for Python environments.

### 🚀 Major Architectural Breakthroughs
*   **Universal GPU IPC (Pure Python/ctypes):**
    *   Implemented a custom, framework-agnostic CUDA IPC protocol (`UniversalGpuIpc`) using raw `ctypes`.
    *   **Performance:** Achieved **~1.5ms latency** for tensor handoffs, beating PyTorch's native IPC by ~30% and Hybrid SHM by **800%**.
    *   Enables true zero-copy data transfer between isolated processes without relying on framework-specific hooks.
*   **Persistent Worker Daemon ("The Kernel"):**
    *   Replaced ad-hoc subprocess spawning with a persistent, self-healing worker pool (`WorkerPoolDaemon`).
    *   Reduces environment context switching time from **~2000ms** (process spawn) to **~60ms** (warm activation).
    *   Implements an "Elastic Lung" architecture: Workers morph into required environments on-demand and purge themselves back to a clean slate.
*   **Selective Hardware Virtualization (CUDA Hotswapping):**
    *   Implemented dynamic `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` injection at the worker level.
    *   The daemon now scans active bubbles to inject the **exact** CUDA runtime libraries required by the specific framework version (e.g., loading CUDA 11 libs for TF 2.13 while the host runs CUDA 12).
    *   **Result:** Successfully ran TensorFlow 2.12 (CPU), TF 2.13 (CPU), and TF 2.20 (GPU) **simultaneously** in a single orchestration flow without crashing.

### ⚡ Core Enhancements
*   **Fail-Safe Cloaking:** Added `_force_restore_owned_cloaks()` to guarantee filesystem restoration even during catastrophic process failures or OOM events.
*   **Global Shutdown Silencer:** Implemented an `atexit` hook that synchronizes CUDA contexts and silences the C++ "driver shutting down" noise, ensuring clean exit codes for CI/CD.
*   **Composite Bubble Injection:** The loader now automatically constructs "Meta-Bubbles" at runtime, merging the requested package bubble with its binary dependencies (NVIDIA libs, Triton) on the fly.

### 🐛 Critical Fixes
*   **PyTorch 1.13+ Compatibility:** Patched the worker daemon to handle `TypedStorage` serialization changes in newer PyTorch versions, preventing crashes during native IPC.
*   **Deadlock Prevention:** Implemented `ThreadPoolExecutor` in the daemon manager to allow recursive worker calls (Worker A calling Worker B) without deadlocking the socket.
*   **Lazy Loading:** Made `psutil` and `torch` imports lazy within the daemon to prevent "poisoning" the process with default environment versions before isolation takes effect.

### 📊 Benchmarks (vs v1.x)
*   **IPC Speed:** 14ms (v1 Hybrid) → **1.5ms** (v2 Universal).
*   **Context Switch:** 2.5s (v1 Cold) → **0.06s** (v2 Warm).
*   **Concurrency:** Validated "Framework Battle Royale" (NumPy 1.x + 2.x + Torch + TF running concurrently).

## [1.6.0]

# omnipkg v1.6.0: The Quantum Lock & Concurrency Release

After a monumentally productive weekend and over **70 developer commits**, this release transforms omnipkg from a powerful tool into a battle-hardened, production-grade orchestrator. This isn't just an update; it's a foundational rewrite of the core engine, focused on eliminating race conditions, conquering state corruption, and achieving true, safe concurrency on all platforms, including Windows.

With over **6,000 lines of code changed**, this release introduces an entirely new level of intelligence, compatibility, and resilience to the system.

## 🚀 New Features & Major Architectural Victories

### True, Multi-Platform Concurrency: The "Impossible" Achieved

Omnipkg now fully supports simultaneous, parallel operations without corrupting its own state. The "Quantum Multiverse" is no longer just a concept—it's a reality. Our Windows CI now proves that **three concurrent threads can simultaneously swap to different Python versions, install different package versions, and operate in the same environment without a single failure.**

This was made possible by a ground-up re-architecture of state management:
- **Atomic Registry Operations:** All writes to the interpreter `registry.json` are now protected by file locks and atomic move operations.
- **The "Admin vs. Worker" Firewall:** A critical safety rule has been implemented. The "native" interpreter is a protected "admin" context, and "worker" contexts (e.g., a thread on Python 3.9) are forbidden from modifying the native environment, solving the primary source of self-syncing bugs and race conditions.

### Intelligent, Trustworthy Self-Healing

The "zombie state"—where an interpreter exists on disk but is unknown to the registry—has been eradicated. The core commands are now self-aware and capable of healing the system.
- **Smart `swap` Command:** Now features a multi-tiered fallback that will **automatically trigger a full filesystem rescan** to find and register "zombie" interpreters before proceeding.
- **Hardened `adopt` & `remove`:** These commands are now fully transactional, performing a final rescan to verify the ground truth before reporting success. The system will never lie to you again.

### Full Python 3.7+ Compatibility & Next-Gen Resolution

- **Legacy Project Support:** Omnipkg now fully supports managing projects running on Python 3.7. The entire dependency chain has been updated, and omnipkg can now download and manage standalone Python 3.7 interpreters.
- **Smarter Dependency Resolution:** Omnipkg now intelligently calculates the correct intersection of version requirements (e.g., `numpy<2.0` vs. `numpy>=1.26`).

### Platform-Aware Intelligence & User Experience

- **Platform-Aware Wheel Selection:** Omnipkg now inspects all available package files, parsing wheel tags to select the best binary wheel for your specific OS, CPU architecture, and Python version.
  > *Pip may still be a reckless time traveler, but with omnipkg, it's now carrying the right passport.*
- **"Return to Origin" Install Guarantee:** The `install` command now automatically returns you to your original Python context after a "Quantum Healing" event.
- **Blazing Fast Startup (204x Faster Self-Heal):** The startup self-heal check has been optimized with a multi-tiered caching strategy, reducing its execution time from **138ms down to a mere 0.677ms** on a cache hit.

## 📝 Important Notes & Known Issues

- **Native Interpreter Sync:** To ensure maximum safety and respect for the user's environment, the self-healing mechanism will sync all *managed* interpreters automatically, but it will **not** automatically upgrade the *native* `omipkg` installation. This is intentional. To upgrade the native installation, please use the explicit `omnipkg upgrade omnipkg` command, or `pip install -e .` for developers.
- **Python 3.7 Self-Heal:** While Python 3.7 is now fully supported for adoption, installation, and swapping, the self-healing logic for identifying it as a "native" interpreter is still under development. This is a known issue that will be resolved in an upcoming patch release.

## 🔮 What's Next: Activating "Quantum Installation"

The individual pieces of our next great leap are already here. This release doesn't just promise future features; it ships the proven, foundational technology for them.

The `install` command's **"Quantum Healing"** engine can already perform fully autonomous, cross-interpreter installations—detecting Python version incompatibilities, adopting the correct Python version, installing the package, and seamlessly returning to the original context. The `run` command's **auto-healing loader** can already activate version "bubbles" at runtime.

The next major step is to **integrate these two proven technologies.**

In a near-future release, the `omnipkg run` loader will be wired directly into the Quantum Healing engine. When a script `import`s a package that requires a completely different version of Python, the loader won't just fail—it will trigger the full, cross-dimensional installation workflow that `omnipkg install` uses today.

The architecture is built. The engine is battle-tested. The final integration is the next logical step. The multiverse is not just expanding; it's becoming fully interactive.

## [1.5.8] - 2025-10-26

### 🌟 Major New Features

## v.1.2.1

omnipkg v1.2.1: The Phoenix Release — True Multi-Interpreter Freedom

omnipkg v1.2.1: The Phoenix Release 🚀
This is the release we've been fighting for.

In a previous version (v1.0.8), we introduced a groundbreaking but ultimately unstable feature: Python interpreter hot-swapping. The immense complexity of managing multiple live contexts led to critical bugs, forcing a difficult but necessary rollback. We promised to return to this challenge once the architecture was right.

Today, the architecture is right. Version 1.2.1 delivers on that promise, rising from the ashes of that challenge.

This release introduces a completely re-imagined and bulletproof architecture for multi-interpreter management. It solves the core problems of state, context, and user experience that make this feature so difficult. The impossible is now a stable, intuitive reality.

🔥 Your Environment, Your Rules. Finally.
omnipkg now provides a seamless and robust experience for managing and switching between multiple Python versions within a single environment, starting from the very first command.

1. Zero-Friction First Run: Native Python is Now a First-Class Citizen
The single biggest point of friction for new users has been eliminated. On its very first run, omnipkg now automatically adopts the user's native Python interpreter, making it a fully managed and swappable version from the moment you start.

Start in Python 3.12? omnipkg recognizes it, registers it, and you can always omnipkg swap python 3.12 right back to it.
No more getting "stuck" after a version switch.
No more being forced to re-download a Python version you already have.
2. The Python 3.11 "Control Plane": A Guarantee of Stability
Behind the scenes, omnipkg establishes a managed Python 3.11 environment to act as its "Control Plane." This is our guarantee of stability. All sensitive operations, especially the creation of package bubbles, are now executed within this known-good context.

Solves Real-World Problems: This fixes critical failures where a user on a newer Python (e.g., 3.12) couldn't create bubbles for packages that only supported older versions (e.g., tensorflow==2.13.0).
Predictable & Reliable: Bubble creation is now 100% reliable, regardless of your shell's active Python version.
3. Smart, Safe Architecture
omnipkg runs in your active context, as you'd expect.
Tools that require a specific context (like our test suite) now explicitly and safely request it, making operations transparent and reliable.
What This Means
The journey to this release was a battle against one of the hardest problems in environment management. By solving it, we have created a tool that is not only more powerful but fundamentally more stable and intuitive. You can now step into any Python environment and omnipkg will instantly augment it with the power of multi-version support, without ever getting in your way.

This is the foundation for the future. Thank you for pushing the boundaries with us.
