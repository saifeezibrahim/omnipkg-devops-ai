# Python Interpreter Hot-Swapping

omnipkg eliminates the need for separate virtual environments or containers to manage different Python versions. With the `swap` and `python` commands, you can instantly "hot-swap" the active Python interpreter for your entire shell session.

This is a cornerstone feature for working on legacy projects that require an older Python version while developing new features on a modern one, all within the same terminal.

### How It Works: The Control Plane

omnipkg uses a stable "control plane" (running on Python 3.11) to manage all interpreter operations. When you request a swap, omnipkg:
1.  Validates that the target interpreter is managed.
2.  Atomically updates its configuration to point to the new interpreter's executable.
3.  Adjusts shell-level pointers (like `python` and `pip` symlinks) within its managed environment to reflect the change.

The result is a near-instantaneous switch of your environment's context, without restarting your shell.

### Managing Your Interpreters

#### Step 1: Adopting Interpreters
On first run, omnipkg automatically "adopts" your system's default Python. To make other installed Python versions available for swapping, you must adopt them.

```bash
# Make your system's Python 3.9 available to omnipkg
omnipkg python adopt 3.9

# Make your system's Python 3.10 available
omnipkg python adopt 3.10
```

#### Step 2: Listing Available Interpreters
To see which interpreters are ready for swapping, run:
```bash
omnipkg list python
```

### Hot-Swapping in Practice

The `omnipkg swap` command is the easiest way to switch your active Python.

#### Direct Swap
If you know the version you want, specify it directly:
```bash
# Check current version
python --version
# Python 3.11.5

# Swap to Python 3.9
omnipkg swap python 3.9
# 🎉 Successfully switched omnipkg context to Python 3.9!

# Verify the change
python --version
# Python 3.9.18
```

#### Interactive Swap
If you want to choose from a list of available interpreters, run the command without a version:
```bash
omnipkg swap python
```
This will present an interactive menu where you can select your desired Python version.

### Use Case: Multiverse Analysis

This powerful feature enables "multiverse analysis," where a single script or CI/CD pipeline can execute tasks across multiple Python versions in sequence, within a single environment. The `omnipkg stress-test` command is a live demonstration of this capability, proving its robustness and efficiency.
