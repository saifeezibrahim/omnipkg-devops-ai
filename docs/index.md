# omnipkg - The Ultimate Python Dependency Resolver

> One environment. Infinite Python and package versions. Zero conflicts.

## What is omnipkg?

omnipkg is not just another package manager. It's an intelligent, self-healing runtime orchestrator that breaks the fundamental laws of Python environments.

### 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-Version Support**: Run multiple versions of the same package simultaneously
- **Python Hot-Swapping**: Switch Python interpreters mid-execution
- **Auto-Healing**: Automatically fix dependency conflicts in real-time
- **Universal Execution**: Handle any Python input - scripts, heredocs, pipes, inline code
- **Zero Downtime**: Microsecond-level package switching

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install omnipkg
pip install omnipkg

# Run the interactive demo
8pkg demo

# Install multiple versions
8pkg install torch==2.0.0 torch==2.7.1
```

### Why omnipkg?

Traditional package managers force you to choose: Docker overhead, slow venv switching, or dependency conflicts. omnipkg makes these problems irrelevant.

- **5-7x faster** than UV for healing workflows
- **Concurrent Python versions** in one environment
- **Auto-healing** for broken dependencies
- **24 languages** supported via AI localization
